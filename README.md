# Roll the Dice – The Ultimate Risk & Reward Game!
🕹️ How to Play:
Each player takes turns rolling the dice to rack up points.
Roll as many times as you dare—but beware!
Roll a 1? Ouch! You lose all your round points, and your turn ends immediately. 😱
Feeling lucky? Keep rolling. Feeling cautious? Hit "Hold" to bank your hard-earned points into your Global Score and pass the turn.
First to 100 points (or a custom target) wins bragging rights and eternal glory! 🏆🎉

Will you play it safe or risk it all for the win? Roll the dice and find out! 😈🎲
